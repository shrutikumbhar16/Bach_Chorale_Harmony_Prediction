# Bach_Chorale_Harmony_Prediction
Harmonic Analysis of Johann Sebastian Bach's Chorales
The analysis of harmonic intricacies in Johann Sebastian Bach's chorales is a cornerstone of music theory and analysis. This project focuses on the exploration of pitch sequences, chord progressions, and rhythmic patterns to uncover the underlying harmonic structures of these compositions.

The goal was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the harmonic progression within Bach's chorales. This was achieved through the application of advanced feature engineering techniques, enabling the model to effectively analyze and classify the harmonic structures in the music.

Key components of the project include:

1.Examination of pitch sequences and chord progressions.
2.Development of a classifier using machine learning techniques.
3.Application of advanced feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.

This project demonstrates the intersection of music theory and computational analysis, leveraging data-driven methods to uncover the complexities of Bach's harmonic composition.
